# Encoding Utility

This is a ColdBox Module to assist in resolving character encoding issues. For example, when a legacy database supports only 7-bit ASCII, and the modern web application receives user content in UTF-8.

## Requirements
- Lucee 5+
- ColdBox 4+
- Java 8+

## Installation

Install using [CommandBox](https://www.ortussolutions.com/products/commandbox):
`box install encoding-utility`

## Usage

Within the component you'd like to make use of the Encoding Utlity, have WireBox inject an instance for you from the module's namespace:
```
property name="encutil" inject="encodingUtility@EncodingUtility";
```
These are the methods implemented:
- `substitute(string input)` Returns the content with reasonable substitutions made. For example, "Ã©" becomes "e".
- `substituteForJSON(string input)` Performs substitutions, being conscious of JSON serialization.
- `isBasicLatin(string input)` Tests the input for any code points above 127.
- `getStringDetails(string input)` Returns a structure of useful information.
